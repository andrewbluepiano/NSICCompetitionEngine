# Welcome to the NSICCompetitionEngine!

The engine is still a work in progress, but what is posted functions once you add a few things on your end. At this time you will need to have some understanding of web backends to use this code. You should be fine if you dont know PHP or HTML, but you will need to be at least familiar with SQL, web backends, and general program flow to use this. <br>
Later commits will be tailored towards usability without requiring any prior knowledge of anything.

## Things you will need installed:
A webserver (Apache) that supports PHP and SQL. <br>
A SQL DB matching the structure posted in SQLdbStructure. You can tweak and use that file to create the DB's.


## Files to configure
- A config.ini file that you will need to fill out with appropriate SQL account information. This is the format(vars) that the posted code looks for. 

- Run a search for "PATH" over all files. You will need to update those and create the relevant paths.

<br>
That should be it, it's not very pretty right now on the backend, but it's functional.
